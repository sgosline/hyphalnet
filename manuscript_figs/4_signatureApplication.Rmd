## NanoPots spatial proteomics data

To determine the ability to use the network signatures to evaluate external, non-cancer datasets, we used our network signatures to improve the ability to interpret spatial proteomics data from Piehowski et al.

We first used the image pseudocolors to map each voxel to one of the three identified tissue types. 

```{r spatial proteomics scores}



```

## Mapping voxels to signatures

Describe the python code required to map novel data to signatures

```{r voxel signatures}


```

## Selecting meaningful signatures

We used the jaccard distance scores to identify those network signatures that best correlated with each tissue type.

```{r signatures}

```
