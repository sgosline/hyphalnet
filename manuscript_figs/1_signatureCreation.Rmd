## Signatures are distinct based on proteomics measurements

We employ the louvain clustering on the multigraph to determine protein-specific signatures. We use network mutual information to show that these are distinct from clustering based on the original protein-protein interaction network


```{r NMI analysis}

## Signature represent distinct biological pathways

By design, the network clustering approach identifies network signatures that represent distinct biological pathways according to the Gene Ontology.
