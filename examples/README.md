# HyphalNet examples

We are currently evaluating hyphalnet in various settings

## Proteomic Data Commons Networks
The largest data repository so far for processed proteomic data is the [PDC](). From this repository we have processed six different cancer datasets and built HyphalNetworks for each cancer type based on patient protein expression compared to pooled normal. The code can be found [here](./cancerProtFeatures).

## Proteomic Drug Response
We are evaluating the ability for proteomic networks to correlate with drug response in AML patients. That analysis will be found [here](./proteomicDrugResponse).

## PDX Drug Response
We are also evaluating the ability to analyze PDX mutational data using networks.
